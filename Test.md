#Exercise 5
    
        1    Mary is a teacher. She teaches x students. Her students scored the following grade in a Math test.
            {
                math: [76, 68, 86, 97, 55, 62, 71, 68, 75, 64, 98, 63, 87, 69, 73, 98, 69, 78, 96, 76]
            }

            (a)Find the value of x

            (b) Write code that will find the average of the Math test grades.

            Hint:: you might need to create a function to do this

            Note: The following questions are optional. It is up to you to decide if you want to do them or not. If you do, make sure you do them in the order they are listed below. 
            

            (c) Write code that will tell Mary how many students scored a A, B, C, D, or F in the test.

            (d) Write code that will tell Mary how many students scored a C or higher.
            
            (e) Write code that will tell Mary how many students scored a B or higher.

            (f) Write code that will tell Mary how many students scored a A or higher.
